Changelog
=========

## 1.6.0 (2024-06-11)

### Enhancements

* Auto-inject OTLP traceparent headers into network requests sent via URLSession. [259](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/259)

* Added support for trace and span IDs to be added to bugsnag-cocoa error notifications if the library is present. [263](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/263)

### Bug fixes

* When we detect a long delay after viewDidLayoutSubviews where viewDidAppear still hasn't been called, assume that this edge case has been triggered and use the time of viewDidLayoutSubviews instead. [257](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/257)

* Detect app backgrounding earlier to detect interrupted app starts and cancel their spans (which would otherwise be VERY long). [262](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/262)

* Workaround for badly behaved NSURLSessionTask classes to avoid a crash. [267](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/267)

* Removed duplicate makeCurrentContext check that was leading to a memory leak. [268](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/268)

## 1.5.0 (2024-03-18)

### Enhancements

* Add package BugsnagPerformanceSwift, and deprecate package BugsnagPerformanceSwiftUI.
  [251](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/251)

* Add API to support UIViewControllers that use generics
  [250](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/250)

### Bug fixes

* Guard against an edge case where an auto-captured URL request with a nil URL can crash the library if it's sent before Bugsnag is initialized.
  [253](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/253)

## 1.4.1 (2024-02-28)

### Bug fixes

* Use ObjC strings instead of C strings to avoid ASAN lifetime race condition
  [247](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/247)

* Fixed the issue causing PrivacyInfo collisions when using Cocoapods
  [246](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/246)

## 1.4.0 (2024-01-31)

### Enhancements

* swizzleViewLoadPreMain setting is now false by default. When this config value is true, all custom view controllers are swizzled at app start, which may delay app start if there are many of them.
  [202](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/202)

* Detect pre-loaded views and correct their durations. These can occur in container views, such as `UITabViewController` when the view is loaded in anticipation of the user opening the next tab. The resulting spans are now marked with a "pre-loaded" suffix and the timings adjusted to start from `viewWillAppear` only. 
  [236](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/236)

### Bug fixes

* Use recursive mutexes in places that might be reentrantly accessed.
  [242](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/242)

* Fix for potential incorrect span list size due to race condition.
  [238](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/238)

* Ensure that swizzled method return values are always propagated correctly.
  [202](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/202)

  [211](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa-performance/pull/211)
