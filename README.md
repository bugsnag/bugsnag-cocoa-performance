# BugsnagPerformance

Development repository for [ROAD-847 - Client-side performance monitoring](https://smartbear.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/pages/3287256229)

Slack: [#bugsnag-proj-client-side-performance](https://smartbear.slack.com/archives/C039590SDQD)

Once sufficiently developed, the intention is to merge the code from this repository into [bugsnag-cocoa](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa) and add support for CocoaPods and Carthage.

## Organization

The library in this repository is structured as a [Swift Package](https://www.swift.org/getting-started/#using-the-package-manager), following SPM's default directory structure.

Double-click `Package.swift` to open the project in Xcode, or select the folder in Xcode's `Open...` dialog.
